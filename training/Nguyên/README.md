You can download the file from the release folder or go to this link here:     
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AKVog8Als5ZOzzNFGKLMt5g8-O-Ov5A0  
To run the file, first extract the zip or the files you downloaded to a folder, let's take example, Release folder.  
Then edit the link in the sum.cmd as the link to the current folder you're saving the files.  
Example:  
If you are storing the files in Release folder on D: drive, then the command you will edit be:  
java -jar D:\Release\MyBigNumber.jar %1 %2  

Then you add the link of the folder to the environment path.  
Open the cmd/powershell and run :   sum 55 66
