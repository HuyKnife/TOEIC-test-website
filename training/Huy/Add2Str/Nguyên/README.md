Right now I use IntelliJ to code but apparently you can use any IDE to open and run MyBigMain.java file.

ATM I'm having an issue with system language so I can't check whether it can be compile with console (CMD) but I believe there won't be any problem so far.

The code to compile using console should be like following:

   1. First and foremost, you must direct to the folder saving these files.  
   2. javac MyBigMain.java   
   3. java MyBigMain sum(a, b)     //a, b would be the string of numbers   
  ex: java MyBigMain sum(2,3)
  
 For best performance, I recommend using IDEs
